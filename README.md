Understanding Gradient Descent through Animation 📈

🔍 What is Gradient Descent? Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used in machine learning and statistics to minimize a function. It’s particularly important in training models to find the optimal parameters (weights).

💡 Visualization Breakdown:

The animation shows the cost function (Mean Squared Error) minimizing over iterations.
The blue line represents the cost value decreasing as the algorithm iteratively adjusts parameters (beta_0 and beta).
You can see the parameter updates (beta_0 and beta values) and how they affect the cost at each step.

Code Overview 🧑‍💻

This animation was created using Python and Matplotlib’s FuncAnimation. The code simulates a simple linear regression with multiple independent variables (x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5).

Key Points in the Code:

Data Normalization: Helps stabilize the learning process.

Gradient Descent Loop: Adjusts parameters based on learning rate and cost function.

Cost Function: Visualizes how the error (difference between prediction and actual values) reduces over time.

Why Visualization Matters

Animations like these make it easier to understand complex algorithms by visually showing how they work in real-time. 📊
